Kumbaya is a Visual Studio extension that adds a window for using CampFire to chat it up. At this point, it's still far from useful. Features that need to be added are:

* Upload files
* Download files
* Selectable text in the chat window
* Leave chat rooms
* Truncate chat room messages to reduce memory pressure
* Convert image links to images (like real campfire does)
* Make links in messages clickable
* etc.

This is mainly a playground for me to play with the CampFire API (curtesy of Matches.Net), Caliburn.Micro, and Visual Studio Extensions.

Extension is available in the visual studio extension manager or from [the extension gallery][1]

Pull requests are welcome.
